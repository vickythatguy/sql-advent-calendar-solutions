-- Table Schema:
-- Table: holiday_orders
--   order_id: INT
--   customer_name: VARCHAR
--   gift_wrap: BOOLEAN
--   paper_used_meters: DECIMAL
--   delivery_status: VARCHAR
--   order_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

select sum(paper_used_meters) as total_paper
from holiday_orders
where (gift_wrap = 1) and (delivery_status like 'Delivered')
