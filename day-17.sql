-- Difficulty: medium

-- Question:
-- During a quiet evening of reflection, Cindy Lou wants to categorize her tasks based on how peaceful they are. Can you write a query that adds a new column classifying each task as 'Calm' if its noise_level is below 50, and 'Chaotic' otherwise?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: evening_tasks
--   task_id: INTEGER
--   task_name: VARCHAR
--   noise_level: INTEGER

-- My Solution:

select *, case when noise_level<50 then 'Calm' else 'Chaotic'  end as tsk1
from evening_tasks
