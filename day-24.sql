-- Table Schema:
-- Table: user_goals
--   user_id: INT
--   user_type: VARCHAR
--   goal_id: INT
--   goal_status: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

with cte as (
  select user_id ,user_type, count(goal_id) as cnt
  from user_goals
  where goal_status like 'Completed'
  group by user_id, user_type
)
select user_type, avg(cnt)
from cte 
group by user_type
