-- Table Schema:
-- Table: elves
--   elf_id: INT
--   elf_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: vacations
--   elf_id: INT
--   start_date: DATE
--   return_date: DATE
--

-- My Solution:

SELECT elves.elf_id, elf_name, IFNULL(MAX(return_date),'Still resting') as return_date
FROM elves LEFT JOIN vacations
on elves.elf_id= vacations.elf_id
group by elves.elf_id
