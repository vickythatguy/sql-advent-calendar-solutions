-- Table Schema:
-- Table: grinch_prank_ideas
--   prank_id: INTEGER
--   target_name: VARCHAR
--   prank_description: VARCHAR
--   evilness_score: INTEGER
--   created_at: TIMESTAMP
--

-- My Solution:

WITH CTE AS (
  SELECT *, dense_rank() over (partition by target_name order by evilness_score desc, created_at desc) as rnk
  from grinch_prank_ideas
)
select target_name, prank_description
from cte 
where rnk=1
