-- Title: Hot Cocoa Break Logs

-- Question:
-- Jack Frost wants to review all the cocoa breaks he actually took — including the cocoa type and the location he drank it in. How would you combine the necessary tables to show each logged break with its matching cocoa details and location?

-- Table Schema:
-- Table: cocoa_logs
--   log_id: INT
--   break_id: INT
--   cocoa_id: INT
--
-- Table: break_schedule
--   break_id: INT
--   location_id: INT
--
-- Table: cocoa_types
--   cocoa_id: INT
--   cocoa_name: VARCHAR
--
-- Table: locations
--   location_id: INT
--   location_name: VARCHAR
--

-- My Solution:

select cocoa_name, location_name
from cocoa_logs c1 join break_schedule bs on c1.break_id = bs.break_id
join locations l on l.location_id = bs.location_id
join cocoa_types ct on c1.cocoa_id=ct.cocoa_id
